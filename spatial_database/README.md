# About the course
Data types in many new applications domains, such as spatial, multimedia and a wide range of scientific applications, are often represented 
as multi-dimensional data. Data management and query processing techniques for multi-dimensional data are significantly different from the 
relational data. This course covers a selection of database topics to provide students with the critical thinking of issues related to 
techniques for multi-dimensional data management and analytics. Spatial and multimedia database management concepts, theories and 
technologies, from data representation, indexing, fundamental operations to advanced query processing, as well as challenges and solution for 
high dimensional data will be introduced.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of the course, students will be able to understand:

1. The latest in large-scale data management and processing: complex data types and similarity-based queries
2. How to represent and manage complex data to enable efficient processing of advanced queries
3. Applicable to a wide range of applications, including spatial and multimedia data
4. Challenges and solutions for high dimensional data

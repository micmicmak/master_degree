# Outlier Detection by Nested-Loop
Given the dataset Nested_Points.txt with 327 points on a 2D Euclidean space, you 
should apply the Nested-Loop algorithm to find the outliers.

## Notes
1. You are NOT allowed to use any existing Nested-Loop library. You need to 
write your own code of the Nested-Loop (but basic library is okay, e.g., Numpy).
2. In your report, please explain your parameter settings (e.g., distance threshold)
and write down the coordinates of the outliers detected by your algorithm and your 
parameters. You also need to draw a picture of the result by marking the outliers 
by RED. You only need to report one group of proper parameter settings.

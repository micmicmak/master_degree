## Four Binary Classification Data Sets
You will use four binary classification data sets which are available in the data folder.

When you load each .npz data file, you will find four NumPy arrays train X,
train Y, test X and test Y. Each row of X stores the features of one example
and the corresponding row of Y stores its class label (0 or 1). As is always
the case, the class label files for the test sets should not be used for classifier
training but only for measuring the classification accuracy on the test data.

##  Multi-class Data Sets
The dataset consists of a training set of 1,437 examples and a test set of 360
examples. Each example is a 8 ˆ 8 grayscale image, associated with a label
from 10 classes. The multi-class data set can be found in the “multi-class”
sub-directory.

# Comparison of Classifiers
We utilize different classifiers for classification.

You are required to implement the following classifiers and compare the performance achieved by
different classifiers.

- Decision Tree

You should build decision trees on the dataset in terms of entropy and gini criterions. For
each criterion, you should set the depth as {5,10,15,20} respectively. You need to compare
the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and training time) and give a brief
discussion.

- KNN, Random Forest

Apply three different classifiers KNN and Random Forest on the dataset. For each classifier,
evaluate the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and training time). You are
required to compare the performance of different classifiers and give a brief discussion.

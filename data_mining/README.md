# About the course
Data mining has recently emerged as a major field of research and applications. Aimed at extracting useful and interesting knowledge from 
large data repositories such as databases and the Web, data mining integrates techniques from the fields of database, statistics and AI.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Apply the clustering techniques to find clusters within the data 
2. Use the classification techniques to conduct classification and predication.
3. Use the knowledge of frequent pattern mining to discover patterns from the data.
4. Conduct mining over social media and text data and detect outliers from the data.

# DBSCAN
Given the dataset DBSCAN_Points.txt with 1212 points on a 2D Euclidean space, 
you should apply DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the dataset and find outliers.

## Notes
1. Draw a picture for your cluster results and outliers in each parameter setting in 
your report. For clearly, in each picture, the color of outliers should be BLACK
and the color of each cluster should be UNIQUE and different from BLACK.
2. Add a table to report how many clusters and outliers you find in each parameter 
setting in your report.
3. Discuss the results of different parameter settings and report the best setting that 
you think and write your reason clearly. To explain the reason, you may also need 
to draw a picture with your selected parameters.

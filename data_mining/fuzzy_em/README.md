# Fuzzy Clustering using EM
Given the training data EM_Points.txt, you should implement the Fuzzy Clustering 
using EM algorithm for clustering.

## Notes
1. You are NOT allowed to use any existing EM library. You need to implement it 
manually and submit your own code (but basic library is okay, e.g., Numpy).
2. Report the updated centers and SSE for the first two iterations (If you set any 
hyperparameter when computing SSE, please explain it clearly in the report).
3. Report the final converged centers for each cluster

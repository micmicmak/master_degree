# FNN
In Tutorial 1, we have seen an FNN model for the Iris dataset written using Pytorch. In this assignment, you are asked to write a program 
that builds a two-layer neural network for the Iris dataset from scratch. A framework of the program is provided in this folder. The first 
layer is a ReLU layer with 10 units, and the second one is a softmax layer. The network structure is specified in the "train" function.

The parameters are learned using SGD.  The forward propagation and backward propagation are carried out in the "compute_neural_net_loss" 
function.  The codes for the propagations are deleted.  Your task is to fill in the missing codes.

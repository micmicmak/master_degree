# Softmax model
In “programming-assignment1”, there is a program that is designed to learn a softmax model for the Iris dataset (included).  In the program, 
there is a function, compute_softmax_loss, that computes the softmax loss and the gradient. It is left out. In this assignment, you are asked 
to write the function.

# CNN
In the code page for Tutorial 2, there is a CNN model for the CIFAR10 dataset written using PyTorch. In this hands-on assignment, you are 
asked to do some experiments with different hyperparameters using the program and report the results.

In your experiments, start with the baseline model from Tutorial 2 and 

- Vary the number of hidden layers (at least two options)
- Vary the number of filters (at least two options)
- Vary the learning rate (at least two options)
- Try different optimizers (at least three)
- Try batch normalization.   

In total, you will need to run at least 10 experiments.

### Notes
As the dataset is too large to upload to GitHub, please refer to the original CIFAR10 dataset if necessary.

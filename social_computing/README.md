# About the course
This course is an introduction to social information network analysis and engineering. Students will learn both mathematical and programming 
knowledge for analyzing the structures and dynamics of typical social information networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and MSN). They will also 
learn how social metrics can be used to improve computer system design as people are the networks. It will cover topics such as small world 
phenomenon; contagion tipping and influence in networks; models of network formation and evolution; the web graph and PageRank; social graphs 
and community detection; measuring centrality; greedy routing and navigations in networks; introduction to game theory and strategic behavior; 
social engineering; and principles of computer system design.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Use the knowledge of social networks to discover influential nodes and communities.
2. Identify human behavior on social networks and recommend events or users based on user profiles and connections.
3. Recognize the influence of nodes and edges and design viral marketing based on social influence analysis.

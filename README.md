# About the program

Big data is poised to change the way enterprises function and a society operates, and is changing the way engineering and science is conducted. 
The Master of Science (MSc) Program in Big Data Technology aims to educate students about big data and issues related to big data. Students are 
expected to be familiar with the workflow of big data systems and social and societal implications of big data systems. Jointly offered by the 
Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Mathematics, the program integrates different disciplines to allow students 
to know all the important aspects of big data and how it is used in the real world.
